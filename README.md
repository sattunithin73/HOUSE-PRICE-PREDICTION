🏡 House Price Prediction – Machine Learning Project

A machine learning project that predicts house prices based on key features such as square footage, number of rooms, location attributes, and more.
This project focuses on data preprocessing, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation using regression algorithms.

📌 Project Overview

This project aims to build a reliable model that predicts house prices using historical housing data.
I used Python, Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn to clean the data, engineer useful features, and train a regression model.

The final model achieved 85% accuracy using Decision Tree Regression, outperforming the baseline linear regression model.

🔧 Tech Stack

Python

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib / Seaborn (optional for visualization)

Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

🔍 Features

✅ Data cleaning and handling missing values
✅ Feature engineering for better model performance
✅ Train-test split and model evaluation
✅ Implementation of Decision Tree Regression
✅ Model accuracy of 85%
✅ Comparison with baseline models

📊 Model Performance

Algorithm Used: Decision Tree Regression
Accuracy Achieved: 85%
The Decision Tree model performed better than standard Linear Regression due to its ability to capture non-linear relationships in the dataset.
